# windows-junk-cleaner

this script clears every temporary file from the user and system, removes every dump file, clears windows update garbage (note: thereafter you won't be able to revert updates back), runs windows's built-in cleanmgr and clears the recycle bin

it needs to be run as admin to be able to do it's fullest, to do so, open up an elevated command line in the script's directory and do "py [script name].py"
